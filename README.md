# weather_cloud
A cloud that simulates weather

Eventually this will have a raspberry pi monitoring inputs (probably twitter, but also possible a weather API) to trigger sound and lights (neopixels controlled by an arduino) to simulate a weather condition.

The development folder is where the scripts that I used to figure out how various parts live. Once it reaches a stable version they will only exist for reference.
